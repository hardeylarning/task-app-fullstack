# Steps on how to run backend server
1. install dotnet 8 SDK.
2. run `cd TodoAPI`
3. run `dotnet build` to build the project
4. run `dotnet run` to start the backend server

Note: the backend uses SQLIITE file based database means you don't need to setup any database

Due to some engagement and time limitation, resource protection might have been considered(Authentication and Authorization) and also test cases too.
Future update will put this into consideration. Thank you.
